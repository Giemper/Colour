Colour was done as a practice for Android Development. The idea is simple enough, sometimes you just need a quick reference of a color when developing an app or web site. Here's where Colour comes in. Inspired by Google's Material Design, the app is made to be the simpliest color picker posible. Colour will display the selection in RGB Hex number.
